We are currently developing on the staging branch, where all ongoing work and updates are committed. Once a sprint is completed, 
the finalized code will be merged into the main branch.

Throughout the development process, we will regularly push updates to the staging branch, while the main branch will only contain 
stable and production-ready code.
